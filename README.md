# happy dog-o-ween
an exploration of dogs wearing clothes

### lots of dogs in clothes on meetup
You may not have realized it, but Meetup probably leads the world in pictures of dogs wearing clothes.
This hackathon project was built to surface these photos. While the app uses about 5,400 photo urls, we found nearly 28,000 photos that are presumably of dogs wearing clothes.

### how i found the photos
The photo urls in urls.yaml were sourced in an unscientific way from the Meetup API based on a couple assumptions. In other words, we don't actually know for sure if a photo is of a dog wearing clothes or not - but usually these assumptions are correct:
 - Groups who have dog topics might have pictures of dogs in clothes, especially small breed dogs.
 - From these groups, we can assume that any photo albums they own contain photos of dogs in clothes if they contain keywords like "halloween" or "parade"

### give dogs candy
If you like a dog, or like candy, click on the candy button. I record each candy given by dog, so maybe one day I can make a leaderboard of dogs in costume.

### why?
Because I can. Also, I wanted to practice using python a little bit more.
